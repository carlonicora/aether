## Overview of the Game
What can we dream for Æther to achieve? That you can have fun and spend some time living incredible adventures. 

If this is your first encounter with a TTRPG manual, welcome to one of the best possible hobbies in the world. I will try and give you a short introduction to what a TTRPG is, even if I believe that if you are holding this book in your hand, you already know much about the game already.

One of the players will take the role of Game Master. Their role is to be the moderator of the game, setting the adventure and running the game for the other players. The rest of the players will take the part of our heroes, the everyday's characters thrown in the incredible. Whichever role you are in, remember that role playing games are not a "us against them", nobody loses, but the more you play collaboratively, the more fun everyone at the table has.

The Game Master will either pick a pre-written adventure to run or will home-brew a story. Their role is like the director of a film, a film in which the plot is drafted by them, but where the final story is written by all the players. You don't decide what the player characters will do, and the more freedom you will allow them, the more you all will have fun.

If you are wearing the clothes of a character, you have to realise you can be whoever you want. Maybe an archaeologist, or a cabaret singer if you like. The only thing to remember that role playing games are collaborative games, and that the Game Master will go above and beyond to create a fantastic world for you. Be open to play the wonders in front of you, challenging the status quo of your character, taking risks and enjoying every moment.

The game is like a make-believe, where everyone describe their character's action, and the Game Master interact as the rest of the world. Some players like to describe their character's action and words in third person, others like to be immersive. Play as you feel comfortable.

As during the game there will be actions which may require some skills to be performed, like for example jumping over a fence, Æther offers a very simple set of rules. If you want to help the game, learn them in the next chapters, the game wi
