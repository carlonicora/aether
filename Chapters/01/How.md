## How to Use this Book
This book has been written to help you live great stories. It is divided in three main parts.

The first part will tell you how to play, introducing to the RAW Mechanics of the game. Don't worry, this is a rule-light game. You will be guided through the character creation, to then be introduce to the rules of action. We appreciate some games support a solitary creation of your character, but we believe in bonding with your fellow player, and the character creation phase should be one of those moment spent together!

The second part of the book will focus on the world of Ã†ther. [Chapter 6](Chapters/06/World.md) will introduce you to the information both Game Masters and players alike should read, while [Chapter 7](Chapters/07/CoreConcepts.md) will contain information that might spoil some fun for the players. Yet, despite the secrets hidden in the world, every adventure will be different!

Lastly, the final part of the book is dedicated to the Game Masters and to everyone who wants to become one. In [Chapter 8](Chapter/08/StorytellingNarration.md) you will find an introduction to being a game master, while [Chapter 9](Chapter/09/PlottingImmortality.md) is a very opinionated guide on how to become a Great Game Master. You can disagree with it and play the way you like, or you may be tempted to read a different approach. Whichever you decide, remember to have fun: that's all that matters.
